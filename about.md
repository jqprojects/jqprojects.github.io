Hi everyone! I've created this blog as a personal project to talk about my other
personal projects (lol). I also want to document what I learn in the process of
developing my projects. A little bit about my self, my name is Gerardo Quintero.  
I'm a 4th-year Computer Science student. My first language (mother tongue?) is
Java, and I'm learning Android development to specialize in. I've also played
with C/C++, since I have a love/hate relationship with low-level concepts.
Python3 is my second language of choice. Especially when I'm writing utility
scripts to make life easier for myself.

I do enjoy learning, but I can only learn so much from reading. I learn best
by doing projects the involve the concepts I'm learning. So I've played around
with Ruby, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS but I've never really worked with them. So
by creating this blog with [Jekyll][1], it's given me a chance to learn more about
web development. I get to learn a new skill set and have a place to talk about
my projects! Win-win :D
